# Main PTF Configuration File

#
### This is the base directory where PTF will install the files
BASE_INSTALL_PATH="/pentest"

### Specify the output log file
LOG_PATH="src/logs/ptf.log"

### When using update_all, also update all of your debian/ubuntu modules
AUTO_UPDATE="ON"

### This will ignore modules and not install them - everything is comma separated and based on name - example: modules/exploitation/metasploit,modules/exploitation/set or entire module categories, like /modules/code-audit/*,/modules/reporting/* MAKE SURE THERE IS NO SLASH AT THE BEGINNING
# Currently ignored: SniffAir (breaks other wifi tools due to system wide installation)
IGNORE_THESE_MODULES="modules/wireless/sniffair,modules/powershell/powershell,modules/auxiliary/python-3_7"

### This will only install specific modules that are specified here - example: modules/exploitation/metasploit,modules/exploitation/set. You can also do entire directories by doing /modules/code-audit/*
INCLUDE_ONLY_THESE_MODULES=""

### Ignore these modules when installing install_update_all by default. These are usually applications that are either large in nature, open ports, or install things (like TOR). This will only be an issue when you run install_update_all, you can still install these manually. MAKE SURE THERE IS NO SLASH AT THE BEGINNING
IGNORE_UPDATE_ALL_MODULES=""

### This will set the privilege on the tools for the corresponding user and group from within a module
# DO NOT CHANGE IS ALSO SET IN MODULE
USERNAME_PATH="/tmp/.ptfuser"

# Another method for setting the user (commented out in code)
#TOOL_OWNER=""
#TOOL_GROUP=""
